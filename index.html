                                <p>Lyle Kepkey, I love that man. He is so down to earth and kind. 
                                  He can put a smile on anyones face with just a few words.
                                  He is really passionate about web development and his craft. 
                                  Lyle is always willing to help with problems relating to any type 
                                  of work he can help with.
                                  He is definitely a great addition to any team or company.
                                  He works really well in a team and can bring a team alive and 
                                  help them in any way possible. However, if needed he works 
                                  really well alone as well.</p>

                                <p>Lyle is a man of few words and more action. He does not 
                                  shy away from a challenge and he is very resourceful. When 
                                  you ask for his help, he is always there and will try to the 
                                  best of his ability. He is a good team player and takes pride 
                                  in his work. His commitment to meeting deadlines and delivering 
                                  quality work is outstanding. I would recommend Lyle for any web

                                    He had a keen eye for design, and he was able to bring my

                                    He was also incredibly thorough in his work, ensuring that
